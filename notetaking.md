## What is HTML?

HyperText Markup Language

It is a markup labguage not a programming language.
We use html to structure content on a Web page

- Used to structure content on a web page (images, text, forms etc)
- We structure content using HTML tags

/.../

HTML is the core language that provides the backbone of a website, and its all to do with how we store content using these different types tags.

## What is CSS

Cascading Style Sheets

CSS is the second parrt of the puzzle when it comes to building websites on web pages, and it stands for cascading style sheets.

Essentially CSS is a separate languuage that goes hand-in-hand with HTML, and what we do is you CSS to style our web page and make them look even better. So HTML alone just structures the content that we want to show in a webpage, but CSS is what makes that content look better. So we´ve used CSS in conjunction with an HTML file to tell the browser things like what color different bits of content on a page should be, or what font size the different headings or paragraph text should be, whether something shoould be oon the left or the right of the page, or maybe what the backgoruund image of the webpage should be.

So whereas HTML is very much to do with providing the actual content and structure to the browser, CSS then takes on the role of styling that content, so much like a builder would form the structure of a house, a painter and decorator would then come in and style it to make it look nicer.
